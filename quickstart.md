## Note

If you do not have Node.js on your computer, please install Node version 17 or higher

<br />

## Follow these steps to run the application locally

### 1. Unzip the src folder

### 2. From command line, navigate to the unzipped src folder

    cd src

### 3. From inside the src folder, run the following command

    npm install

this will install npm-run-all in the root folder (will be used to install depencies for both the client and the server and start both environments)

### 4. After npm install, from the src folder, run the following command

    npm run all

this will start up the server and open the client on a new browser tab.

### 5. Have fun testing!
